# The Oddysey

to do:
  - sort length of second-most post issue
  - fix GAS script (?) so its not showing image twice (could be to do with the url tree and categories)
  - add nice category intro/description to the relevant card (i.e. saying if a tree article is short, show where to click on its parent       genus/species) - this could go on the article page, same for each ina  category
  - add 'click image to read full article' above the image, and make the image the external link
  - maybe this means editing the script & sheet so it includes tree genera as well (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tree_genera)
  - fix GAS script so it skips articles that have been done
      - adding new 'completed' column to the g sheets?
