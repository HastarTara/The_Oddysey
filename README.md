# The Oddysey

to do:

  - 

  - Download Google Clasp for local GAS editing and deployment to GDrive? doesn't add much though... maybe nicer hotkey workflow
  
  - Write a master script to run all the individual scripts when they've all been run and tested individually - would require a master mode flag to be passed as a parameter to each script that they have a default setting for. (start this on next script?)  

  - Add the script that generated the Streetview Panos CSV to github. same for the GAS scripts but REMOVE CREDS LIKE GITHUB TOKEN

  - I have the CSV of random streetview panos. Implement the GAS that will post it to TheOddysey

  - SPLASH
    - add color theme toggle (so i can see for production without turning my dark flag off - also to get cool colorful inversions i.e. of splash page. Also swich the src of the logo (white to black, etc)

    - work more on splash page - add lock mechanism? and change button so the the eye is centered again  

  - POSTS
    - sort 2nd and 3rd post image crop formatting (all older ones work fine)
  
    - add nice category intro/description to the relevant card (i.e. saying if a tree article is short, show where to click on its     
    parent genus/species)... this could go on the article page, same for each in a  category
      
      -  maybe this means editing the script & sheet so it includes tree genera as well         
        (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tree_genera)
  
    - add 'click image to read full article' above the image, and make the image the external link
      
  - fix GAS script so it skips articles that have been done
      
      - adding new 'completed' column to the g sheets? alternatively - remove the row, add to 'completed' spreadsheet. This would stop the increase of limited GAS row-read operations over time.
