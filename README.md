# The Oddysey

to do:

  - Download Google Clasp for local GAS editing and deployment to GDrive? doesn't add much though... maybe nicer hotkey workflow
  
  - Write a master script to run all the individual scripts when they've all been run and tested individually - would require a master mode flag to be passed as a parameter to each script that they have a default setting for. (start this on next script? see second below todo item)  

  - Add the GAS scripts to github for review but REMOVE CREDS >=>=> implement .env file.

  - SPLASH
    
    - add color theme toggle (so i can see for production without turning my dark flag off - also to get cool colorful inversions i.e. of splash page. Also swich the src of the logo (white to black, etc)

    - work more on splash page - add lock mechanism? and change button so the the eye is centered again  

  - POSTS

    - Format the maps articles - change size of thumbnail? have image link straight to google maps, skip the embedding on oddysea? this would allow being able to easily see the date of the pano
       
    - sort 2nd and 3rd post image crop formatting (all older ones work fine)
  
    - add nice category intro/description to the relevant card (i.e. saying if a tree article is short, show where to click on its 
    parent genus/species)... this could go on the article page, same for each in a category
      
      -  maybe this means editing the script & sheet so it includes tree genera as well         
        (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tree_genera) - same deal for 'common fish names', etc. wikipedia has irregular structures...
  
    - add 'click image to read full article' above the image, and make the image the external link - same for the maps articles.
      
  - make sure all gas scripts have the skip if already processed functionality. in future implement the transferal of completed rows to a new sheet (this wont become a problem for a long time if its only attempting to retrieve one article per category per day)
