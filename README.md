# The Oddysey

to do:
  - sort length of second-most post issue
  - fix GAS script (?) so its not showing image twice (could be to do with the url tree and categories)
  - add nice category intro/description to the relevant card (i.e. saying if a tree article is short, show where to click on its parent       genus/species)
  - fix GAS script so it skips articles that have been done
      - adding new 'completed' column to the g sheets?
