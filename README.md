# The Oddysey

to do:
  
  - sort 2nd and 3rd post image crop formatting (all older ones work fine)
  
  - add nice category intro/description to the relevant card (i.e. saying if a tree article is short, show where to click on its     
    parent genus/species)... this could go on the article page, same for each in a  category
      
      -  maybe this means editing the script & sheet so it includes tree genera as well         
        (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tree_genera)
  
  - add 'click image to read full article' above the image, and make the image the external link

  - fix GAS script so it skips articles that have been done
      - adding new 'completed' column to the g sheets?
